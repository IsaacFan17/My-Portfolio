<h1>The Best Movies According to Isaac</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>
<p>Laughters and tears. This movie tells how love fall aparts and brings people back together. And it's not asian-baiting. </p>
<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>Enlightments for every human being with little knowledge of what the feminism could be like back in two centuries ago.</p>
<h3>Split</h3>
<p>Personally I don't like this movie that much but at least I spent one night with one man I had crush on just for watching this.</p>
